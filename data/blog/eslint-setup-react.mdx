In this blog post, I will walk you through how you can add ESLint and Prettier to your React project.

Firstly let us talk about what linting is and why it is important.

## What is Linting?
Linting is the act of analyzing your code to identify and flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
The term "lint" as used in the software context is derived from the English noun lint, the fine tiny bits of fiber and fluff shed by clothing.
Most of the time these fibers are unwanted and are annoying. On surfaces of clothes, this lint is removed using a lint brush or a lint roller.
This lint brush or a roller would be the equivalent of a linter in the software context.

A linter is a software that does the linting.
For our case, our linter is going to be [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

Most programming languages have linters developed for them for example:
- Python has [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- Go lang has [Golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)
- etc ..

Other Javascript linters include
- standard js https://standardjs.com/
- rome https://rome.tools/#about-rome
- jslint https://www.jslint.com/
- etc ..

## Why lint your code?
- Linting will help you identify possible syntax and logical errors reducing bugs in your code.

  Example, Look at the code below, the spinner would never show up.

<Image
  alt={`constant condition`}
  src={`/static/images/eslint/constantcondition.png`}
  width={1254 / 2}
  height={358 / 2}
  priority
/>

  It is easy to forget and commit this hard-coded conditional check, but because the linter has highlighted it, you know to fix it before committing your code.

- Linting also helps you find code whose formatting does not follow the defined styles.
- Linting will also help you find code that does not adhere to coding standards and conventions.

To summarize, linting your code will help you write clean code. Code that is readable, easy to maintain, and has minimal bugs.

Now that we understand what linting is and why it is important,  let us go ahead and add ESLint to our React project.
If you don't have a React project, you can quickly create one using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).
## Create React Project
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

## Installing ESLint

At the root of your project, install ESLint by running the following command.

```
npm install eslint --save-dev
# or
yarn add eslint --dev
```
## Configuring ESLint
To set up an ESLint configuration file, run the commands below at root of your project:

```
npm init @eslint/config
# or
yarn create @eslint/config
```
<Image
  alt={`constant condition`}
  src={`/static/images/eslint/eslintconfig.gif`}
  width={1254}
  height={1000}
  priority
/>


`.eslintrc.js` file will be created. You can use this file to define your ESLint settings for example to turn on and off rules.
Note that I selected the [Airbnb javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
You are free to use whichever style guide you prefer. You can also define your own style guide.

You can read more about using the config file [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#using-configuration-files)


## Linting code
With ESLint added to the project and configured, you can lint your code by running the command `eslint`.
So we are going to add this command to our scripts in the `package.json` file

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    ...
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
```

## Fixing lint warnings and errors
Running the command `eslint` alone just reports the lint errors and warnings. 
Some of these errors and warnings can be automatically fixed by ESLint while the rest need to be manually fixed.
To automatically fix the errors add the flag `--fix` to the eslint command.
Let us update our scripts in the package.json with a command to fix the errors and warnings

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    ...
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint-fix": "eslint . --fix"
  },

 ```
With the above-updated package.json, to lint your code, run the command:

```
npm run lint
```
To lint and fix the errors and warnings, run the command:
```
npm run lint-fix
```
We now have ESLint set up for our project. 
We can lint our code and fix the errors and warnings

Let us make this configuration better by adding Prettier


## Prettier
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter.
What that means is that prettier allows you to format your code to a  style defined by you.
Prettier is [open source](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), so you can contribute to it, to make it more opinionated ðŸ˜…
### Adding prettier

At the root of your project, run following command.
```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
#or
yarn add --dev --exact prettier
```

### Configuring prettier
At the root of your project, run following command.
```
echo {}> .prettierrc.json
```
`.prettierrc.json` will get created. Use this file to define how you would like your code formatted.
I will add two simple rules for now.

```
{
  "printWidth": 100,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

### Using ESLint with prettier
To use ESLint with Prettier install [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation)
```
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
```
### Extending "prettier" in your ESLint config

```
 extends: [
    'plugin:react/recommended',
    'airbnb',
    'prettier'
  ],
```

You can also add a command in your scripts for prettier.
```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    ...
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint-fix": "eslint . --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  },
```

And that is how you can set up ESLint and prettier in your React project
To recap.

- To lint, run `npm run lint`.
- To lint and fix,  run `npm run lint --fix`.
- To format using prettier, run `npm run format`.
